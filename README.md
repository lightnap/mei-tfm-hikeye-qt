# Hikeye Qt

This is my Master's Thesis project for the Master in Informathics Engineering offered by the UPC school. 

In this project we use GPS data of routes through the mountains recorded by hikers in order to create a visualization that gives us information about the terrain and the habits of hikers. 

This project was build using QT. 

There are some images of the finalized product.

This one shows the UI of the QT application.
